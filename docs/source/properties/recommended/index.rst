This section outlines all the metadata properties used by the Health Data Australia (HDA) portal. Each metadata property is drawn from either the Australian
and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) or from DataCite. In order for a dataset to appear in the HDA portal, its trial needs to be registered
in ANZCTR *and* a DataCite DOI needs to be minted.
