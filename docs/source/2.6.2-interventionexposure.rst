ANZCTR Step 3 - Description of intervention(s) / exposure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Occurrences:** 1

**Input type:** Text

**Example input:** “Dexamethasone (10 mg) or placebo was administered 15 to 20 minutes before or with the first dose of antibiotic in Arm 1. Studies in animals have shown that bacterial lysis, induced by treatment with antibiotics, leads to inflammation in the subarachnoid space, which may contribute to an unfavourable outcome [references]. These studies also show that adjuvant treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, such as dexamethasone, reduces both cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and neurologic sequelae [references].”
